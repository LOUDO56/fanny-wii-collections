# fanny-wii-collections
This projects is for my mother who is collectionning all the Wii Games from Europe<br/>

# How this work

This project work with NodeJS and Javascript.<br/>
I use a Full Wii Game list database from <a href="https://www.gametdb.com">GameTDB</a> to maintain the list.<br/>

This website use a database where I put all wii games from Europe who includes English and French language, there is about 1268 games in it.<br/>

The website does not work for more than one person because the purpose of this project is to be accessible only to my mother.<br/>
If you want to use it in your own, just download the source code in ZIP file and modify things on your own.<br/>
